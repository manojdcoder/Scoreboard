### Code review with Faisal

- I have used a ScrollView to make it easy for small screens and different device orientation.
- He has used local variables for everything, where in I'm taking the values from the controls at runtime.
- He has images for each team where in I have used simple Text
- He has used check change event to keep the values locally in a variable, I do pick it up upon button click.
- Overall he has focused on reusing variables than querying components everytime, I have focused on less code as possible to achieve the requirement.
